          In my travels around the globe with Colin we've visited Argentina,
          Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, England, France,
          Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru,
          Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, The Netherlands and USA. My obsession
          with MotoGP has seen me travel to circuits in Phillip Island (2
          times), Australia; Sepang (2 times), Malaysia; Jerez, Spain; Le Mans,
          France; Mugello, Italy; Catalunya, Spain; Assen, The Netherlands;
          Brno, Czech Republic and Spielberg, Austria. Next stop is Burriram,
          Thailand.

          In 1999, Colin and I, along with Kate and Gemma set off around
          Australia for 6 months in an off-road camper trailer. In 2014, I spent
          4 weeks on the back of Colin's motorcycle travelling from Maryborough,
          Queensland back to Perth. In 2015 we both spent 6 days riding Ducati
          motorcycles around Tuscany, Italy.

          I have had a diverse work history. I've worked in the Government
          sector, Gold Mining, Engineering, Airconditioning, Wine, Day Spa, Rail
          and at an Airport. I have been a secretary, an accounts clerk, a
          cellar door salesperson, a beauty therapist, an auditor and a safety
          and systems professional. Web developer is next on the list, maybe ...
          if I can work this s#!? out.
